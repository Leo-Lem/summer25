## [[3. Rahe_FSE_2025.pdf]]: Programming students' GenAI use
- **Problem**: unknown LLM practices by students -> how to work with genai in education?
* **Results**
	* Pass introductory programming course with only chatgpt? Introductory exam could not be passed when using interview-style code review.
	* Strategies when using ChatGPT? Two main strategies: knowledge gaining and generate answers.
	* Delegation and autonomous thinking with ChatGPT? Less critical thinking, often try to stupidly generate answer.
* **Threats to Validity**
	* model volatility and prompt sensitivity
	* language bias: only german
	* selection/participant bias: more confident/higher performing students
	* observer effect: change conduct under observation
	* generalisability: one university, one course
	* limited task scope
	**not addressed in the paper**:
	* tool familiarity: custom gpt interface
	* incentivization effect: more interest in reward than participation
	* assessment influence: quiz-style instead of authentic open-ended coding
	* zero-shot prompting does not fairly model student behavior. also course content like slides should be included for better comparison.
