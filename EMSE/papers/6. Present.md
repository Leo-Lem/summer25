## [Lueders: Automatic issue links](6.%20(present)%20Lueders_RE_2022.pdf)
* **Summary**: Trained BERT model for detecting issue links (like epic or duplicate).
* **Problem**: Lack of automated issue linking causes toil.
* ***Results**
	* How do state-of-the-art e2e deep learning models compare on issue tracking? BERT is by far the most accurate, encouraging results for more link types.
	* How do different repositories compare in regard to link types? Link type confusion and best practices are evaluated.
### Introduction
- Issue trackers to manage/maintain products/requirements (JIRA, GitHub Issues, …).
- Issue property prediction/automation: type, priority, assignment, …
- Links relate issues (duplicate, subtask, epic, …) and help improve issue management.
- RQs laid out.
### Methods & Context
**Motivation**: importance of issue linking, issue duplicate prediction, advances like BERT, large datasets.
**Dataset**: 16 public JIRA repos. jira has more links than bugzilla. issue coverage (with links) 36% avg. Mindville excluded for too few links (44).
**Duplicate v. clone**: accidental v. clone feature in jira.
**Input**: Title and description (concatenated).
**Labels**: link types (relate, duplicate, subtask, depend, epic, clone, incorporate, cause, block).
**Models**: BERT, DistilBERT. single-channel (separate enoding of issues) and dual-channel with FastText and word2vec.
**Metrics**: F1 per link type, macro- and weighted per repo.
**Baseline**: RF and SVM with tf-idf.
### Results
**Preliminary**: BERT outperforms in all setups. focus on BERT for rest of the paper.
**Macro F1**: .64 across 15 repos, moderate to top per repo. key difference link coverage.
**Duplicate and clone**: are distinguished by model, marked difference apparently.
**Subtask and epic**: top scores (average 0.89 and 0.97 F1). 
**Depend, incorporate, block, cause**: low performance.
**Relate**: jack-of-all-trades confuses model, but overall decent 0.69 F1.
**Non-links**: encouraging top performance 0.96 (Mojang), overall good.
### Analysis & Discussion
**Repo differences**: independent of issue number, coverage is important, negative correlation with number of link types. assignee issue ratio indicative of higher prediction performance -> more homogenous repo.
**Link differences**: clone and duplicate differ a lot: clone are similar, duplicate not. Epic and subtask connect token-dissimilar issues with good differentiation also from non-links. Longer text is bad (-0.7), share of link type is good for relate, duplicate, depend, incorporate.
**Practical applicability**: fairly general due to e2e (no feature engineering), not much adjustment needed.
**Improvements**: 1. two-stage where first model predicts if linked, second link type. ignore relate link which is usually not that descriptive. 2. predict categories of semantically related links, specific type can be selected by stakeholders. 3. top-k predictions presented to stakeholders.
**Data quality**: important for prediction, issues often mislabeled as relate, because relate is misused.
**Further research**: coverage, more linking as best practice for better link quality. less heterogeneity by scoping per project or project-cluster instead of repository.
**Threats to validity**: 1%-share lower bound might bias -> same model can still be applied. multi-links excluded as they were mostly conflicting and irrelevant. model should generalise to bugzilla (default types are subset of jiras), but github issues has no linking per se. non-links were added to dataset, more could impact performance.
**Related work**
- Agile: rise of issue trackers, information overload in JIRA (fucci), tackled by situational method engineering (franch), similar problems for linking.
- RE: traceability between requirements/issues and software. can also be predicted with BERT. unclear feature descriptions and lacking traceability mirrored by heterogeneity findings.
- Issue link prediction: duplicate is most researched. good predictions with dual-channel. use bugzilla.
- Issue linking generally:  little consistency, github linking patterns.
- most work focuses on link types individually.
### Conclusion
- BERT performed well generally. Very well for epic and subtask.
- Improving issue and link quality should have positive effect.
- Future work: repository, project and stakeholder factors. user studies and qualitative research recommended.
