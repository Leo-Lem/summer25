## [Lueders: Automatic issue links](6.%20(present)%20Lueders_RE_2022.pdf)
* **Summary**: Trained BERT model for detecting issue links (like epic or duplicate).
* **Problem**: Lack of automated issue linking causes toil.
* ***Results**
	* How do state-of-the-art e2e deep learning models compare on issue tracking? BERT is by far the most accurate, encouraging results for more link types.
	* How do different repositories compare in regard to link types? Link type confusion and best practices are evaluated.
### Introduction
- Issue trackers to manage/maintain products/requirements (JIRA, GitHub Issues, …).
- Issue property prediction/automation: type, priority, assignment, …
- Links relate issues (duplicate, subtask, epic, …) and help improve issue management.
- RQs laid out.
### Methods & Context

### Results

### Analysis & Discussion

### Related work

### Conclusion
- BERT performed well generally. Very well for epic and subtask.
- Improving issue and link quality should have positive effect.
- Future work: repository, project and stakeholder factors. user studies and qualitative research recommended.
