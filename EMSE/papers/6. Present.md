* **Summary**: Trained BERT model for detecting issue links (like epic or duplicate).
* **Problem**: Lack of automated issue linking.
* ***Results**
	* How do state-of-the-art e2e deep learning models compare on issue tracking? BERT is by far the most accurate, encouraging results for more link types.
	* How do different repositories compare in regard to link types? Link type confusion and best practices are evaluated.
